RSA-Encryptor-Decryptor

Overview
Implementing RSA encryption and decryption for secure text communication. This repository contains a Python implementation of the RSA algorithm, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt text messages using public and private keys.

Features
Key Generation: Automated RSA key pair generation for seamless encryption and decryption.
Text Encryption: Utilize the RSA public key to encrypt plain text messages securely.
Text Decryption: Decrypt cipher text using the corresponding private key, ensuring confidentiality.
Example Code: Clear and concise example code to guide users in integrating RSA encryption into their projects.
Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/RSAEncryptorDecryptor.git

2. Explore the example code and integrate RSA encryption into your projects.

Usage:
from rsaencryptordecryptor import generate_keys, encrypt, decrypt

# Generate RSA key pair
private_key_pem, public_key_pem = generate_keys()

# Encrypt and Decrypt
original_text = "Hello, RSA encryption!"
cipher_text = encrypt(public_key_pem, original_text)
decrypted_text = decrypt(private_key_pem, cipher_text)

print(f"Original text: {original_text}")
print(f"Cipher text: {cipher_text}")
print(f"Decrypted text: {decrypted_text}")
